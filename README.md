# EigenVector-acceleration-CUDA

Eigen vectors and eigen values are crucial part of many machine learning algorithms. However, for large data, computing eigne vectors is a computationally complex task. This project is focused on accelerating the calculation of eignevectors and eigenvalues using Jacobi Parallelization.

Find the parallel code in jacobi.py and serial code in jacobi_serial.py.
